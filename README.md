## About Paranmo
Our project "Paranmo" combines technology from three paths: Mobile Development, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing. Paranmo is a mobile application which can recognize herb plants and inform users with the detail information, the usage, and the benefit of the herb plants easily with a single click of image capture. This application also provides health articles. For the future development, we plan to develop some features, such as "Paranshop (Paranmo Shop)" to connect users with the drugstores, and "Parannity (Paranmo Community)" to share experiences regarding healthy lifestyle.
